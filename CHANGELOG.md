# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The plugin marketplace was renamed from `feature-loop` to `ecukalla-plugins` to
  disambiguate it from the plugin it contains, which is also named `feature-loop`.
  The old `feature-loop@feature-loop` install command read as a typo; it is now the
  self-explanatory `feature-loop@ecukalla-plugins`, and the owner-prefixed name leaves
  room for sibling plugins later. The plugin name is unchanged. A bats regression
  guards the duplication from returning. Existing 0.1.x installs keep working; to pick
  up the new name, re-add the marketplace:

  ```bash
  claude plugin uninstall feature-loop
  claude plugin marketplace remove feature-loop
  claude plugin marketplace add ecukalla/feature-loop
  claude plugin install feature-loop@ecukalla-plugins
  ```

  Closes #11.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- The overlay now pins the Claude CLI to `2.1.156` instead of installing whatever
  `latest` resolves to. `latest` became `2.1.154` (the Opus 4.8 launch) on 2026-05-28,
  which wedges headless `claude -p` runs with a `400 "thinking … blocks cannot be
  modified"` — the autonomous writer crashed every iteration and produced no commits.
  Pinned to the verified-good `2.1.156`, overridable via `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` (still
  presence-guarded, so a base that already ships `claude` keeps it). Closes #27.
- `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` (this repo's gate-toolchain base) builds again: it installs
  `xz-utils` before unpacking the Node tarball. A prior change dropped it and ran the apt
  step after the download, so `tar -xJf` failed with `xz: Cannot exec`. (#29)

### Security

- CI's `validate-plugin` job installs the Claude CLI from a tracked, version-pinned
  lockfile (`tools/package.json` → `2.1.156`, via `npm --prefix tools ci`) instead of
  `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, which pulled `latest` on every run.
  Dependabot tracks the pin weekly; a bats regression guards the unpinned form from
  returning. Closes #10.

### Added

- This repo's own dogfooding config — a tracked root `.featureloop` and
  `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` (Go 1.25 + Node 22.20 + pre-commit + bats + jq) — so
  `/auto-feature` can run feature-loop on itself durably. Kept off the generic plugin
  surface; consumers still bring their own base. Closes #18.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- Engine `build`/`test`/`simplify` phases now invoke their agent-skills skills by
  name (`incremental-implementation`, `test-driven-development`,
  `code-simplification`) instead of the `/build`, `/test`, `/code-simplify` slash
  commands. Those are agent-skills *project* commands that don't load in the headless
  plugin container, so the writer ran as `Unknown command`, made no edits, and the
  loop could never converge or commit. The `security` phase already used the working
  skill-by-name form. Closes #19.
- The autonomous gate phase now runs `FL_GATES` against a clean, git-materialized
  checkout instead of in place on the worktree. On macOS, Docker Desktop's bind mount
  reports spurious executable bits, so `check-executables-have-shebangs` failed ~20
  tracked-but-non-executable files (`README.md`, `Makefile`, …) and a local run never
  went green even though CI (clean Linux checkout) passed. The materialized tree carries
  git's recorded modes and replays uncommitted changes (e.g. the simplify phase's) on
  top. Closes #23.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Bump `docker/overlay-bootstrap.sh` default `NODE_VERSION` from `22.15.0` to `22.20.0` so npm-based pre-commit hooks (e.g. `markdownlint-cli`, which pulls `ava@7` requiring node ≥22.20) install cleanly in the overlay without users having to override `NODE_VERSION`. Closes #12.

### Added

- `scripts/lint-plugin-manifests.sh` catches manifest defects that
  `claude plugin validate --strict` misses: non-semver `version` in
  `plugin.json` or `marketplace.json:.plugins[]`, and marketplace
  `source` paths that don't resolve on disk. Wired into both
  `pre-commit` (runs when `.claude-plugin/*.json` changes) and the
  `validate-plugin` CI job. Closes #8. Requires `jq`.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- `--auth oauth` on macOS now extracts the Keychain credential blob to an
  `mktemp`-named file with `0600` perms, instead of a predictable path under
  `$TMPDIR`. Closes a symlink-attack window where a hostile local user on a
  shared `TMPDIR` could redirect the credential write.
- `FL_ARCHIVE_DIR` set in `.featureloop` is now honored end-to-end. The host
  runner reads it as the host-side path, bind-mounts it into the container at
  `/home/fluser/.feature-loop`, and forces the engine's in-container
  `FL_ARCHIVE_DIR` to that target via `-e`. Previously, a custom
  `FL_ARCHIVE_DIR` in `.featureloop` was silently lost on container teardown
  because the engine wrote to an unmounted path. Inside the engine, env now
  wins over `.featureloop` for this variable so the runner's pin is
  authoritative. The undocumented `FL_HOST_ARCHIVE_DIR` knob is removed.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- `--auth oauth` on `feature-loop-docker` — use your Claude.ai / Max subscription
  inside the container instead of API-key billing. Mounts the credentials Claude
  Code already stores on the host (or extracts them from the macOS Keychain entry
  `Claude Code-credentials` on the fly).
- Per-run archive at `$FL_ARCHIVE_DIR` (default `$HOME/.feature-loop`) — after
  every run, the engine writes a date-stamped directory containing
  `summary.json`, `summary.md`, `STATUS.md`, `retrospective.md`, `diff.stat`,
  `logs/`, and `failures/`, plus a row appended to a cross-run `INDEX.md`.
  The docker runner bind-mounts the host's `~/.feature-loop` into the container
  so artefacts survive worktree teardown.
- Optional retrospective phase: one final Claude call writes a "what went well /
  what needed fixing / what to improve" markdown to `tasks/retrospective.md`.
  Skip with `FL_RETROSPECTIVE=0`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-27

Initial release.

### Added — engine and runner

- `bin/feature-loop`: config-driven build → verify → fix loop. Worktree off
  `origin/<base>`, `/build` as the only writer, parallel read-only gates (`/test`,
  project `FL_GATES`, security audit), failure → fix loop capped at `FL_MAX_ITERS`,
  `/code-simplify` and re-verify, live `tasks/STATUS.md` board.
- `bin/feature-loop-docker`: bring-your-own-Docker host runner. Resolves the base from
  `--image`, `FL_IMAGE`, `FL_DOCKERFILE`, or a neutral public default; wraps it with a
  cached overlay (`docker/overlay-bootstrap.sh`) that injects only the Claude CLI, the
  agent-skills plugin (pinned), and the engine onto any apt base; runs as a non-root
  user inside the container.
- `/auto-feature` Claude plugin command + marketplace manifest.
- `--help` / `--version` on both CLIs; `--no-config` skips sourcing `.featureloop`.

### Added — input validation and threat model

- `TICKET` / `SLUG` validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}$`. They are passed to the
  in-container shell as positional arguments, not via string interpolation, so safety
  doesn't depend on the regex alone.
- Image references (`--image` / `FL_IMAGE` / resolved base) validated against an OCI
  regex that supports private registries with a port (e.g. `localhost:5000/foo:tag`).
- `FL_DOCKERFILE` constrained to a relative path with no `..` component.
- `SECURITY.md` documents the `.featureloop` trust model, the read-write bind mount,
  gate-log redaction guidance, and the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exposure model.

### Added — quality gates and CI

- `pre-commit` stack: shellcheck, shfmt, markdownlint, actionlint, gitleaks, plus
  standard whitespace / JSON / YAML / shebang hooks.
- `bats` test suite covering the CLI contract and the input-validation regexes.
- GitHub Actions: lint + test on every push, weekly `pre-commit autoupdate` (opens a
  PR if hook revs drift; the third-party action is SHA-pinned).
- `dependabot.yml` for GitHub Actions bumps.
- `Makefile` task runner: `make install / lint / fmt / test / clean`.

### Added — project hygiene

- README with badges, layout, and a Development section.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant),
  `ROADMAP.md`.
- `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.shellcheckrc`, `.markdownlint.yaml`.
- GitHub issue forms, PR template, `CODEOWNERS`.
